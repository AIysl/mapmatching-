# MapMatching Algorthims 
I conclude four algothims for mapmatching as follow:
1.Hidden Markov Map Matching Through Noise and Sparseness(HMMM)
2.Map-matching for Low-sampling-rate GPS Trajectories(STMM)
3.An Interactive-Voting Based Map Matching Algorithm(IVMM)
4.AntMapper: An Ant Colony-Based Map Matching Approach for Trajectory-Based Applications(ANTMM)
