# MapMatching Algorthims 
Map matching is the processing of recognizing the true driving route in the road network accroding to discrete GPS sampling datas . It is a necessary processing step for many relevant applications such as GPS trajectory data analysis and position analysis.

I conclude four algothims for mapmatching as follow:

1.Hidden Markov Map Matching Through Noise and Sparseness(HMMM)

2.Map-matching for Low-sampling-rate GPS Trajectories(STMM)

3.An Interactive-Voting Based Map Matching Algorithm(IVMM)

4.AntMapper: An Ant Colony-Based Map Matching Approach for Trajectory-Based Applications(ANTMM)
